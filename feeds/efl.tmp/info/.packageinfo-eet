Title: EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file
Maintainer: 
Source: eet-r40853.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. EET files are perfect for storing data that is written once (or rarely) and read many times, especially when the program does not want to have to read all the data in at once.
