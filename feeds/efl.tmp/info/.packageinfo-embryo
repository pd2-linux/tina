Type: ipkg
Description:   Embryo implements a C like scripting language used in various parts of the Enlightenment project, namely Edje. Embryo's scripting language is based on CompuPhase's Small language that was introduced in Dr Dobb's Journal in 1999. Embryo allows scripting capabilities in places that otherwise wouldn't support basic programming structures such as in Edje EDCs.
