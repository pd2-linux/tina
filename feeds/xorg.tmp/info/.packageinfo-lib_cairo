Description: Cairo is a 2D graphics library. The cairo API provides operations similar
to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo
include stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and
compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All
drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation
(scale, rotation, shear, etc.).
